# Puzzle Blocks Activity 
NOTE: This activity is a work in progress and is still in the testing phase. Feel free to give us your feedback! If you and your group have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!
(NOTE #2: If you are attending in person, we are recreating the blocks from a puzzle block. If you are attending online, we are recreating the blocks from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1565383 Cube Puzzle SOMA, and you can download the file and import it into Tinkercad and recreate them. Let us know if you need assistance for this.)
1. If you haven’t already, please go to [the TinkerCad website and create an account](http://tinkercad.com){:target="_blank"} for yourself. If you find yourself in a tutorial, click on the Tinkercad logo in the top left of the screen to exit to the home page.
2. Click **Create new design**. If the TinkerCad tutorial pane is up on the right-hand side, you will need to get out of it before proceeding. Click on the TinkerCad logo at the top to bring you back to your main page. From there you should see the “Create new design” button. 
3. On the right side of the TinkerCad open a drop-down menu by clicking on **Basic Shapes**, and then select the **Basic Shapes** option if this is not already showing. This will display a list of 3D shapes that you can scroll down through. We will just be using the basic square block (in red) for this activity.
4. Drag and drop a single block onto the workplane.

5. We need to resize the blocks to a smaller size to make them easier to work with. To start doing this click on the block, and then (A) click on the **white dot** on one of the corners of the block (which will then turn red). (B) click on the **20.00** and change the number to “10” and then press the enter key, and the block will change size. Do the same to the top white dot to change the height of the block to **10.00**. 
6. <img src="images/tinkercad-puzzle-02.png" style="float:right;width:220px;height:220px;" alt="block attributes menu"> With the block selected, in the **Box** settings menu, change the **Radius** to **0.5**.  
7. <img src="images/tinkercad-puzzle-03.png" style="float:right;width:220px;height:220px;" alt="copied and rotated blocks in tinkercad"> Now we need to copy and rotate the rectagle blocks. Click on the block to make sure it is selected. You can use **Ctrl + C** and **Ctrl + V** on Windows or **Command + C** and **Command + V** on Apple (key combination on your keyboard) to copy and paste the block. To rotate the block, use the rounded handle that is hovering above the block. 
8. <img src="images/tinkercad-puzzle-04.png" style="float:right;width:200px" alt="aligning the blocks"> Move the blocks together to form the shape you want. If you want to make sure it is properly aligned, select both blocks and then click on the **Align** button at the top (shaped like a graph). <img src="images/tinkercad-puzzle-05.png" style="float:right;width:200px" alt="aligning the blocks"> This will bring up little round, black handles along the edges of the blocks that can be used to align them at the points needed. Once you have the alignment desired, you can click on the **Group** button (looks like a square and circle blended together) to make them into a single shape. 
9. <img src="images/tinkercad-puzzle-06.png" style="float:right;width:200px" alt="the final blocks in various colours"> Repeat steps 1-8 to create shapes to match the Puzzle. 
10. <img src="images/tinkercad-puzzle-07.png" style="float:right;width:200px" alt="the blocks made into a cube"> You can test the puzzle in Tinkercad by moving the shapes around to fit them together to make a cube.
